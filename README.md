# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview
Resampling data with `imbalanced-learn` and `scikit-learn` libraries to build, evaluate and compare four Logistic Regression models `RandomOverSampler`, `SMOTE` `ClusterCentroids` and `SMOTEENN` with two Ensemble Learners `BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and `EasyEnsembleClassifier` that predict credit risk.

## Results
